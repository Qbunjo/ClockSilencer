# ClockSilencer
ClockSilencer is a simple ESP8266 device, that mutes analog pendulum clock from ringing a chime at night.
It operates on batteries, so it has to be energy efficient.
The mechanical servo locks clock hammers at evening and releases them in the morning.
The safest time to lock/unlock the hammers is quarter past hour or quarter to hour, as clock chimes at full hours and half past.

The mechanics of this device must not interfere with original antique mechanism.
